# Machine-Learning

Helo guys! 
FINALLY!!! I succeed to make a simple recommendation system using collaborative filtering! 
But I think I still use the old version of Tensorflow. We can work on it later. 

I used a different dataset. A dataset that consists of userID, placeID, and ratings (I only used the total_rating).
If you want to try by yourself, it's easy:
1. Download the ipnyb file and data folder.
2. Run the ipnyb file using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all of the program sequentially.

Also, I added the other method, the popularity-based model. How to run it? same as above. 

For further information, ask me by WA.
